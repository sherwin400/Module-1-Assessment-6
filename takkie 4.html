               <p>Tasteful trick selection, an eye for creativity, and effortless style are all traits of one of the greatest street riders in the world, Jake Kuzyk. So when we asked Jake which shoe he wanted a signature model in, we were not surprised to hear him say the Style 36. Tying back to JakeÂ’s signature Hi-Standard OG boot, his Style 36 features sturdy canvas and suede uppers, re-enforced toecaps to withstand repeated wear, padded collars for support and flexibility, and signature rubber waffle outsoles.</p>
